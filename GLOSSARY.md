## Mempool

A mempool (short for "memory pool") is a collection of unconfirmed transactions that have been submitted to a blockchain network but have not yet been included in a block. When a user initiates a transaction, it is first broadcast to the network and added to the mempool of each node. Miners/Validator then select transactions from the mempool to include in the next block they mine, typically prioritizing those with higher transaction fees.
Usually each node has its own mempool, and the contents of the mempool can vary between nodes based on factors such as network latency and transaction propagation times.

## Epoch

In blockchain technology, an epoch is a specific period of time during which certain events or processes occur. The definition of an epoch can vary depending on the blockchain protocol being used.

## Slot

In blockchain technology, a slot is a specific time interval during which a block can be proposed or validated. The concept of slots is often used in proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms, where validators are assigned to propose or validate blocks during specific slots.

## Nonce

Number used ONCE. In btc its the value that the miners change to find a valid hash. In eth its used to keep track of the number of transactions sent from a given address. Each time a transaction is sent from an address, the nonce is incremented by one. This helps prevent replay attacks and ensures that transactions are processed in the correct order.

## DAO

A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is an organization that is run through rules encoded as computer programs called smart contracts. DAOs are designed to be transparent, democratic, and autonomous, allowing members to participate in decision-making processes without the need for a centralized authority.

## Hard Fork

A hard fork is a significant change to a blockchain protocol that is not backward compatible. This means that nodes running the old version of the software will not be able to validate blocks created by nodes running the new version.

## Faucet

A faucet is a website or application that dispenses small amounts of cryptocurrency to users for free. Faucets are often used as a way to introduce new users to a particular cryptocurrency or blockchain network, allowing them to obtain a small amount of the currency without having to purchase it.

## Keystore

A keystore is a secure storage mechanism used to store cryptographic keys, such as private keys used for signing transactions in blockchain networks. Keystores are designed to protect sensitive key material from unauthorized access, ensuring that only the owner of the keys can use them.
