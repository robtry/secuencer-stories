- I'm not used to read whitepapers, I thing I need to improve my skimming skills to find the important parts faster.
- I think I feel ready to read [arbirum's intro](https://docs.arbitrum.io/how-arbitrum-works/inside-arbitrum-nitro) now.
- Also it would be great to read [AIP](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposals) (later).

I think I will need more time to understand the theory before jumping deeper into the code.

- I won't be working weekends hahah I have a life outside coding :). (At leat for now).

Since Arb is a L2 based on ETH, I need to understand how ETH works first.

- So go-eth also in ethereum is related to the evm execution layer (p2p). And state management ([mempool](../GLOSSARY.md#mempool)), txs, balances.
- Prysm Beacon Node conects to validator, is exposed to internet p2p and syncs the beacon chain and geth. Only knows about block head, next proposer and finality. DO NOT know about txs or balances. (consensus)
- Prysm Validator is the validator sings the blocks and proposes them to the beacon chain (when selected).Using geth.

Of course a good entry point to understand eth is its [Ethereum Whitepaper](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/).
Nowdays it has a lot of content, explaining the ecosystem, they even implemented [quizzes](https://ethereum.org/quizzes/).

- Definitly helpful to understand the big picture https://ethereum.org/whitepaper/#ethereum

I complemented with

- [Ethereum Yellowpaper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf) which is more technical (I didnt read all of it).
- [Ethereum Explained Visually](https://youtu.be/QGH8XnUnOps). Which drivesme crazy about how EVM pretend to work.
- Thanks to the previos video, somehow I ended up in [math incompleteness](https://youtu.be/HeQX2HjkcNo) and turing machines (which are concepts I only recall from college).
- I did'nt read but it would be great to check [EIP](https://eips.ethereum.org/)

I feel excited to learn about the EVM, actually talking about lines of code, it is the heaviest part of arbitrum nitro (later).
