# Sequencer Stories

My journey learning about Arbitrum Nitro, sequencers, and the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Goal

Build my own L2 fork on top of Ethereum with custom modifications. This repo documents everything I learn along the way.

## What is this?

Heavily inspired by [Navigating cities of code with Norris numbers](https://stackoverflow.blog/2024/08/13/navigating-cities-of-code-with-norris-numbers/). Arbitrum Nitro is a massive codebase, a metropolis of code. Trying not to get lost.
